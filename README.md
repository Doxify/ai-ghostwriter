This project is part of the CASHI Virtual REU 2020 Summer program. I worked with a mentor and a team of other students to research various machine learning sub-fields and developed this app to compliment my research.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigation to `~/client/`, this is the react client directory
3. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
4. Navigation to `~/api/`, this is the flask api directory
5. Install all dependencies with `?`
6. Start the client via `npm start`
7. Start the api via python `api.py`
