# **AI Ghostwriter** (WIP)
AI Ghostwriter is an app that uses RNN to generate texts in various languages. It contains a react web app to allow users to interact with the model and an express api to interface the model with react.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigation to `~/client/`, this is the react client directory
3. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
4. Navigation to `~/api/`, this is the express api directory
5. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
6. You can now start the api and client, you must run `npm start` in both of their root directories.

## Tasks:

* **React Web App**
  * Organize file structure
  * Implement wireframe
  * Create methods for API calls

* **Express API**
  * Figure out how to interface express with a keras model
  * API should be fairly simple, just take in keywords and return text.
