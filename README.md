# **AI Ghostwriter** (WIP)
AI Ghostwriter is an app that uses RNN to generate texts in various languages. It contains a react web app to allow users to interact with the model and an express api to interface the model with react.

This project is part of the CASHI Virtual REU 2020 Summer program. I worked with a mentor and a team of other students to research various machine learning sub-fields and developed this app to compliment my research.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigation to `~/client/`, this is the react client directory
3. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
4. Navigation to `~/api/`, this is the express api directory
5. Install all dependencies with `npm install`
6. You can now start the api and client, you must run `npm start` in both of their root directories.

## Tasks:

* **React Web App**
  * Organize file structure
  * Implement wireframe
  * Create methods for API calls

* **Express API**
  * Figure out how to interface express with a keras model
  * API should be fairly simple, just take in keywords and return text.
